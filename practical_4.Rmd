```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Start

In fact, I'm not sure where to start here, just have a try.

## 4.6 RMarkdown

### 4.6.1 HTML

```{r}
library(terra)
library(here)
jan<-terra::rast(here("wc2.1_5m_tavg", "wc2.1_5m_tavg_01.tif"))
# have a look at the raster layer jan
plot(jan)
```

## By the way

The Visual is much easier to see compared with Source, both in RStudio and Jupyter notebook, I love it!!!
